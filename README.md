# SoloLearn-Code-Coach-solutions

I will be trying to solve all Code Coach problems on SoloLearn in as many languages as I can.
Problems are sorted by difficulty levels and each problem folder will contain solutions in different languages.  
I'll start solving in C, C++, Java, Python as they're already in my bag of skills.

*UPDATE: All code coach problems (pro edition not included) are now solved! Next step would be to solve the easy problems in all possible languages*   
*UPDATE 2: The easy section problems are now solved in all possible languages! Medium section is next*  
*UPDATE 3: The Medium section is now done in all 7 languages! Only the hard section remains !*  
*UPDATE 4: It's all DONE! All 25 Code Coach problems (pro edition not included) are now each solved in all 7 languages(C, C++, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, Swift)!*
