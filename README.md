# SoloLearn-Code-Coach-solutions

I will be trying to solve all Code Coach problems on SoloLearn in as many languages as I can.
Problems are sorted by difficulty levels and each problem folder will contain solutions in different languages.  
I'll start solving in C, C++, Java, Python as they're already in my bag of skills.

*UPDATE: All code coach problems (pro edition not included) are now solved! Next step would be to solve the easy problems in all possible languages*   
*UPDATE 2: The easy section problems are now solved in all possible languages! Medium section is next*
